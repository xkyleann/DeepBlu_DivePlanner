# Dive Calculator 
- The Dive Calculator is a SwiftUI application designed for scuba divers to plan their dives efficiently. This app allows divers to calculate non-decompression limits (NDL), adjusted non-decompression limits (ANDL), and maximum allowable bottom time, considering various factors such as depth, bottom time, surface interval, whether it is multilevel diving, and if it's the first dive of the day.


# Features
* **Dive Mode Selection**: Choose between dive planning, surface interval, and maximum depth calculations. (will be updated)
* **Multilevel Diving Toggle:** Specify if the dive will incorporate multiple levels.
* **First Dive Toggle:** Indicate if this is the first dive of the day.
* **Input Depth and Bottom Time:** Enter the planned depth and bottom time for precise calculations.
* **Surface Interval Input:** Provide details about the surface interval in hours and minutes.
* **Dynamic Calculations:** Based on the inputs, the app calculates and displays the NDL, ANDL, and maximum allowable bottom time.
